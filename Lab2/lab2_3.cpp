/*
Write a C++ program that allows the user to input the number of students in a class. 
    The program should dynamically allocate memory for a 2D array of student information, 
        where each row represents a student, 
        and each column represents their name, ID, and age. 
    The program should prompt the user to enter the details for each student. 
    Finally, it should display the information of all the students

Your program should include the following:
    1. The Student class with the necessary member variables and member functions.
    2. The main() function, where the dynamic allocation of memory and input/output operations take place.
    3. Proper usage of pointers to manage the dynamically allocated memory.

int main(){
    cout << "Enter the number of students: ";
    //cin >> ;
